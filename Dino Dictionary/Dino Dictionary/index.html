	<div class="texti1">The Triassic period (248 to 206 million years ago) began and ended with a massive natural disaster which wiped out around 90 percent of the planet's species. The species that did survive then repopulated the Earth and evolved into completely new creatures.</div> 
	<div class="boxi2"></div>
	<div class="texti2">The dinosaurs survived the natural disaster at the end of the Triassic period and went on to dominate the Jurassic period (208 to 146 million years ago). The supercontinent Pangaea which had dominated the Triassic period was rapidly breaking up, and mountains rising up from the ocean floor pushed sea levels up.</div>
	<div class="boxi3"></div>
	<div class="texti3">The Cretaceous period stretched from 146 to 65 million years ago, and by the end of this period, the landmasses were in much the same position as they are today. Throughout the period the continents had been moving further apart; this and the increasing expanses of ocean caused the climate to become more moist and cool.</div>
