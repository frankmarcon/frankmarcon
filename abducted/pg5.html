<h2 class="title5">We Talked to the Doctor Who Treats People Who Think They've Been Abducted by Aliens</h2>

<p class="p5">
	Nicolas Dumont could not be more casual as we chat about alien abductions. "It's not a hallucinatory experience or a spiritual one," says the clinical psychologist. "The experience leaves physical marks behind, plus victims get extraordinary powers, like the gift of healing or clairvoyance." Dumont's patients believe they've experienced an alien abduction, with some saying they've been taken multiple times. The claims are so convincing in their detail, says Dumont, that he's fairly certain something must have happened.
</p>

<p>
	Dumont isn't the first psychologist to specialize in this. John Edward Mack, a professor at Harvard and former psychiatrist, spent part of his life studying this same phenomenon, following nearly 200 cases of people who believed they had been abducted by aliens. In 2003, he explained in an interview: "When you're talking to a psychotic who's telling you something that seems like a psychosis, you do get the feeling that it never happened. But in these cases, it's nothing like that. These people are healthy. They question themselves sometimes. But they're describing an experience that's real and intense—something being done to their bodies."
</p>

<p>
	A while ago, I spoke to some of Dumont's patients about their experiences. This time, I wanted to chat to the psychologist about how he thinks he can tell whether someone has been abducted or not and why he's convinced that more medical professionals should be open to believing in the supernatural.
</p>

<h3>How many patients have you seen who think they've been abducted by aliens?</h3>

<p>
	Firstly, it's not as if they all come in saying "I was abducted by aliens," but lots of them think that it might be what happened. In the four years I've been doing this, I've seen about 100 patients, all French, who have shown signs of an abduction. I still see five of them regularly, several years after they first came to me. One of them, Sonia, has been experiencing these kinds of abductions since she was little.
</p>

<h3>
	So what's the evidence you look for that makes you believe a patient may have been abducted?
</h3>

<p>
	Often these people tell me they were awoken in the middle of the night and found themselves paralyzed. They saw non-human beings around them, whether they were at home or in an external place that might have been a spaceship. Sometimes they were in both. Some hadn't experienced anything until they woke up at home thinking it was morning before realizing 48 hours had just gone by. We call that "missing time"—it's very common. The best-known case is that of Betty and Barney Hill in 1966.
</p>

<p>
	From there, whatever your culture and background, the same elements are always there. Almost universally, my patients talk about the presence of a table, very specific beings and telepathic contact. Mentioning these specifics right away focuses my thinking toward whether the person has actually experienced something or not. Very often, these people claim to have new powers. Some people can float out of their bodies, while others acquire healing powers. And most have marks on them from the experience.
</p>

<h3>
	What do you do when you are certain that a patient hasn't been abducted?
</h3>

<p>
	It depends on the case. If we're looking at a pathological liar, he won't allow us to dispute his version of events. I saw a patient a while back who had already managed to indoctrinate UFOlogists—he was really feeding off of that, that feeling of being special. That's typical with pathological liars. On the other hand, some do accept that it wasn't an abduction after all. But on my end, I never tell them that they weren't abducted; I never tell someone they're a liar. It's a discussion, and my job is simply to point the person in the right direction.
</p>

<h3>
	You talk about "beings." Are there multiple races of aliens trying to contact us?
</h3>

<p>
	After several years of research and interviews, I'm convinced there are. It seems like there are reptile aliens who sometimes provoke terror, other times a kind of love. Then you have the blond humanoids who are very tall and paternal; patients feel good around them. There are also the little gray men, who are particularly invasive and devoid of empathy. They're the worst because their coldness is very often traumatizing. Some patients also tell me of contact with insectoid creatures, whom they perceive as superior entities—the ones in charge.
</p>

<h3>Why</h3>

<p>
	I truly believe that people who've been abused in the past have already been in contact with a certain "otherness." Their past experiences have created an ontological shock. We might compare this to going outside after having been in a dark room. When you've experienced an intrusion like having been abused as a child, I think you might, unfortunately, be more prepared than others to experience this kind of terrifying contact.
